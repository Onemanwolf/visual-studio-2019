# Color Themes

Color themes let you modify the colors in Visual Studio Code's user interface to suit your preferences and work environment.

## Selecting the Color Theme

1. In VS Code, open the Color Theme picker with **File** > **Preferences** > **Color Theme. (Code > Preferences** > **Color Theme** on macOS).
2. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+K` `Ctrl+T` to display the picker.
3. Use the cursor keys to preview the colors of the theme.
4. Select the theme you want and press `Enter`.

The active color theme is stored in your user [settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) (keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+`,).

```powershell
  // Specifies the color theme used in the workbench.
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Dark+"
```  
>Tip: By default, the theme is stored in your user settings and applies globally to all workspaces. You can also configure a workspace specific theme. To do so, set a theme in the Workspace [settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_creating-user-and-workspace-settings).

## Color Themes from the Marketplace

There are several out-of-the-box color themes in VS Code for you to try.

Many more themes have been uploaded to the VS Code [Extension Marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery) by the community. If you find one you want to use, install it and restart VS Code and the new theme will be available.

Tip: To search for themes, type 'theme' in the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) search box.
