Performance gains
We've taken the once-exclusive C++ data breakpoints and adapted them for .NET Core applications.

We taken the exclusive c++ break points and adapted them for .Net Core applications these break points allow to watch a specific object property even when it goes out of scope and when that object property changes setting the data break point is as simple as searching for the object property you are interested in with the new debug search tool locating the objec property right clicking it and select break when value changes from there you can press F5 to conitune and then you will recieve a notification popup informing you the change accord and where it occured.

So whether you're coding in C++ or .NET Core, data breakpoints can be a good alternative to just placing regular breakpoints. Data breakpoints are also great for scenarios such as finding where a global object is being modified or being added or removed from a list.

And, if you're a C++ developer who develops large applications, Visual Studio 2019 has made symbols out of proc, which allows you to debug those applications without experiencing memory-related issues.

Search while debugging
You've probably been there before, looking in the Watch window for a string amongst a set of values. In Visual Studio 2019, we've added search in the Watch, Locals, and Autos windows to help you find the objects and values you're looking for.
